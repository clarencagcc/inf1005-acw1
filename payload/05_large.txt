**Call of Duty Zombies** is a popular game mode in the *Call of Duty* series, introduced as a hidden feature in *Call of Duty: World at War*. Since its debut, it has grown into a full-fledged subseries with its own storyline, maps, characters, and unique gameplay mechanics. Zombies mode focuses on cooperative survival gameplay, where players face increasingly difficult waves of undead while trying to uncover secrets within the map.

Some key aspects of *Call of Duty Zombies*:
- **Characters and Storyline**: One of the most iconic groups of characters is the Primis crew, featuring Richtofen, Dempsey, Takeo, and Nikolai. Their storyline spans several games, with time travel, alternate dimensions, and complex lore involving Element 115, the Aether, and Apothicons. Primis Richtofen is particularly notable for his eccentric and insane behavior, which many fans, like yourself, enjoy.
- **Gameplay**: Players must survive by buying weapons, upgrading gear via the Pack-a-Punch machine, and navigating traps and puzzles. Popular mechanics include perk-a-colas like Juggernog and Speed Cola, mystery boxes, and Easter eggs that often lead to hidden endings or advanced story revelations.
- **Maps**: Some of the most famous maps include *Der Riese*, *Kino der Toten*, *Origins*, and *Shadows of Evil*. Each map is packed with its own unique challenges, hidden rooms, and lore.

Given your interest in Primis Richtofen, I assume you're into the chaotic and often unpredictable nature of his plans, which keep the Zombies storyline so compelling!

Which part of *Call of Duty Zombies* interests you the most? The lore, the characters, or the gameplay itself?

**Der Riese** (German for "The Giant") is one of the most iconic maps in *Call of Duty Zombies*. It first appeared in *Call of Duty: World at War* as part of the *Map Pack 3 DLC* and has since been remastered in other *Call of Duty* titles like *Black Ops* and *Black Ops III* (where it's called *The Giant*). Here's what makes *Der Riese* stand out:

### 1. **Setting**
*Der Riese* is set in a secret Nazi research facility in Germany, where experiments involving **Element 115** have led to the creation of the zombies. The map is tied to the larger Zombies storyline and is where players first learn about the experiments conducted by **Group 935**, the scientific organization that Richtofen is a part of.

### 2. **Introduction of the Pack-a-Punch**
One of the most groundbreaking features introduced in *Der Riese* is the **Pack-a-Punch** machine, which allows players to upgrade their weapons. This mechanic has become a staple in every Zombies map since. Upgrading your weapons is essential for surviving the higher rounds.

### 3. **Teleporters and Time Travel**
*Der Riese* also features **teleporters**, which players must link to the mainframe to unlock the Pack-a-Punch machine. Teleporters have been linked to time travel and alternate dimensions, themes heavily explored in the Zombies storyline, especially in relation to **Richtofen** and his grander schemes involving the **Aether** and **Agartha**.

### 4. **Story and Characters**
The map is significant for the ongoing Zombies storyline, featuring the original crew—**Richtofen, Dempsey, Nikolai, and Takeo**—as they fight through waves of zombies. *Der Riese* is where much of Richtofen's secret agenda begins to unfold, as players discover audio logs and Easter eggs that hint at his plans for control over the zombies and Element 115.

### 5. **Easter Eggs**
*Der Riese* is packed with **Easter eggs**, some of which were the foundation for future, more complex map secrets. One notable Easter egg involves shooting a fly trap, which triggers a hidden mini-quest. Players have always speculated that the map contains hidden layers to its already mysterious lore.

### 6. **Remastered Versions**
In *Black Ops III*, *Der Riese* was remastered as **The Giant** with updated graphics, new Easter eggs, and expanded lore. The remastered version continues the storyline involving Primis Richtofen, who kills his Ultimis counterpart in one of the most memorable cutscenes in the series.

Overall, *Der Riese* is a fan-favorite map for its combination of tight, intense gameplay, and deep lore that connects it to the larger *Call of Duty Zombies* universe. The map holds a special place for long-time Zombies players, as it’s where many of the mechanics and story elements that define Zombies today were first introduced.

What do you think of *Der Riese*? Does its lore or gameplay stand out more to you?

**Kino der Toten** (German for "Cinema of the Dead") is one of the most beloved maps in the *Call of Duty Zombies* series. It was first introduced in *Call of Duty: Black Ops* and was originally planned to appear in *World at War* as part of the *Der Riese* DLC, but was held back and became the flagship Zombies map for *Black Ops* instead. Here's what makes *Kino der Toten* so iconic:

### 1. **Setting**
*Kino der Toten* is set in an abandoned Nazi theater in East Berlin during the 1960s. The location is eerie and atmospheric, with dilapidated props, eerie music, and occult Nazi symbols scattered throughout. The theater itself is part of a larger storyline where **Group 935** conducted secret experiments with **Element 115**, leading to the outbreak of zombies.

### 2. **Classic Gameplay**
Kino is known for its simple yet challenging layout. The map is ideal for both new players and veterans:
- It has a large central stage area, perfect for training zombies (running in circles to avoid the horde).
- **Traps** like the electric barriers can be used to manage large groups of zombies in later rounds.
- The **Mystery Box** gives players access to powerful weapons but can spawn in different locations, adding an element of randomness to every playthrough.

### 3. **The Thunder Gun**
One of the standout features of *Kino der Toten* is the **Thunder Gun**, a powerful Wonder Weapon that can blow away large groups of zombies in one shot. It quickly became a fan-favorite weapon, especially for high-round runs. Pack-a-Punched, it becomes the **Zeus Cannon**, which makes it even more devastating.

### 4. **Teleporter and Pack-a-Punch**
The **teleporter** on the stage allows players to teleport to the projector room, where they can access the **Pack-a-Punch** machine to upgrade their weapons. After using the teleporter, players are thrown into various bizarre locations, like a doctor's office or a room full of creepy mannequins. This adds a layer of mystery and suspense, especially when considering the grander Zombies storyline.

### 5. **Nova Crawlers**
*Kino der Toten* introduces a new type of enemy called **Nova Crawlers**—zombie-like creatures that crawl on all fours and emit a gas cloud when killed. The gas clouds obscure vision and damage the player, adding another challenge to navigating the tight corridors of the theater.

### 6. **Ties to the Zombies Lore**
*Kino der Toten* continues the story of **Richtofen**, **Dempsey**, **Nikolai**, and **Takeo**—the main characters in the Aether storyline. The map is part of the ongoing narrative where Richtofen is executing his plan involving **Element 115** and the **Aether**. While the map doesn't have an elaborate Easter egg like later maps, it has hints and audio recordings that reveal more about Richtofen’s twisted intentions and experiments with mind control.

### 7. **Enduring Popularity**
Despite being a relatively straightforward map compared to later entries, *Kino der Toten* is loved for its perfect balance of accessibility and challenge. It offers an engaging mix of nostalgia and replayability, which is why it's often considered one of the best Zombies maps in the series. It’s also frequently cited as a go-to map for solo players who want to test their skills in high-round attempts.

The combination of its creepy atmosphere, straightforward yet challenging gameplay, and a map design that's easy to learn but difficult to master makes *Kino der Toten* a timeless experience in the Zombies community.

Do you have a favorite strategy or memory from playing *Kino der Toten*?

**Ascension** is another iconic Zombies map from *Call of Duty: Black Ops*, released as part of the *First Strike* DLC. It's notable for expanding on the mechanics introduced in earlier maps and introducing several new features that have since become staples in the Zombies experience. Here’s what makes **Ascension** stand out:

### 1. **Setting**
*Ascension* takes place in a Soviet Cosmodrome during the Cold War. The map is set in a sprawling space launch facility with rocket pads, control rooms, and research labs. The location is tied to Group 935's experiments with **Element 115**, and the Soviet Union's attempts to harness its power.

The map’s black-and-white intro sequence is memorable, as the game starts in black and white until the power is restored, creating a tense atmosphere right from the start.

### 2. **New Enemies: Space Monkeys**
One of the most unique features in *Ascension* is the introduction of **Space Monkeys**. These enemies replace the traditional "hellhound" or "special" rounds. The monkeys attack during certain rounds and target **Perk-a-Cola machines** that players have purchased. If they destroy a machine, players lose the corresponding perk, adding an extra challenge to defending both themselves and their perks. Players can receive a free perk for successfully defending all the machines.

### 3. **Perk-a-Colas**
*Ascension* introduced two new **Perk-a-Colas** to the Zombies mode:
- **PhD Flopper**: This perk prevents players from taking any explosive or fall damage and allows them to perform a "flop" dive that creates a deadly explosion when diving from a height.
- **Stamin-Up**: This perk increases sprint speed and duration, helping players navigate the large map more quickly and avoid the zombie horde.

These new perks added significant new strategies for survival, especially PhD Flopper, which became a fan favorite for its ability to create explosions.

### 4. **Gersh Device and Matryoshka Dolls**
The **Gersh Device** is a new Wonder Weapon introduced in *Ascension*. It functions like a black hole grenade, pulling in zombies and killing them instantly, while also allowing players to teleport across the map. This made it an invaluable tool for escaping tight situations.

The **Matryoshka Dolls** are explosive nesting dolls that deal massive area damage in multiple stages, making them a fun but unpredictable alternative to regular grenades.

### 5. **Rocket Launch and Easter Eggs**
The **rocket launch** is one of the map's coolest features. By activating certain terminals, players can trigger a massive rocket launch. The launch ties into the map’s narrative about the Soviets' space program and Group 935’s research, and destroying the rocket with powerful weapons gives players bonus points.

*Ascension* is one of the first maps to feature a **major Easter egg** quest, though it’s relatively simple compared to later maps. The Easter egg revolves around helping Dr. Gersh, a Soviet scientist, by completing a series of tasks that involve activating the Gersh Device and other steps to free him from a dimensional rift.

### 6. **Layout and Strategy**
*Ascension* is known for its large and open map layout, which gives players plenty of room for running "trains" (a tactic where players gather a large group of zombies and continuously move in circles to avoid getting trapped). The map is also filled with verticality, allowing for quick escapes using the **lunar landers**, which function as both transportation and evacuation devices.

This map is considered one of the best for beginners due to its wide-open spaces and the ability to easily train zombies in certain areas, particularly the **lunar lander** stations and the rocket platform.

### 7. **The Cast and Storyline**
Like other maps in the Aether storyline, *Ascension* features the classic crew: **Richtofen, Dempsey, Nikolai, and Takeo**. They continue their journey, with Richtofen working toward his plan to control the Aether and manipulate the power of Element 115. *Ascension* further explores the chaos caused by the experiments on zombies and teleportation.

### 8. **Influence on Future Maps**
Many of the features introduced in *Ascension*, such as new perk systems, enemy types, and large map layouts, became a standard in later Zombies maps. It also set the stage for more complex Easter eggs and multi-step quests that have become a beloved part of the Zombies experience.

Overall, *Ascension* is a classic for its innovative gameplay features, memorable map design, and the introduction of Space Monkeys and new perks that changed the way players approached the game. Its combination of lore, survival strategy, and iconic mechanics make it a favorite for many in the Zombies community.

How do you feel about the Space Monkeys? Do you have a favorite strategy for dealing with them or any memorable moments on *Ascension*?


**Call of the Dead** is a standout Zombies map from *Call of Duty: Black Ops*, released as part of the *Escalation* DLC. It’s known for its unique setting, celebrity cast, and for being the first map to break away from the traditional Zombies crew of Richtofen, Dempsey, Nikolai, and Takeo. Here’s what makes **Call of the Dead** special:

### 1. **Setting**
*Call of the Dead* is set in a **Siberian outpost** during a snowstorm. The map features an eerie, frozen environment, including a shipwreck, a lighthouse, and abandoned buildings. The area is believed to be where the Soviet Union was conducting secret experiments with **Element 115**, similar to *Ascension*.

The map's atmosphere is dark and mysterious, blending elements of horror and survival, and it pays homage to classic zombie films. The icy environment also impacts gameplay, as players must navigate slippery terrain and freezing water that can damage them.

### 2. **Celebrity Cast**
One of the most iconic aspects of *Call of the Dead* is its **celebrity cast**, inspired by George A. Romero’s zombie films. The map features four well-known actors as playable characters:
- **Danny Trejo** (famous for *Machete* and *From Dusk Till Dawn*)
- **Sarah Michelle Gellar** (star of *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*)
- **Robert Englund** (best known as Freddy Krueger from *A Nightmare on Elm Street*)
- **Michael Rooker** (from *The Walking Dead* and *Guardians of the Galaxy*)

The characters have their own unique dialogue and personalities, making the map feel like a crossover between a video game and a zombie movie.

### 3. **George A. Romero as a Boss**
One of the most memorable and unique features of *Call of the Dead* is the inclusion of **George A. Romero**, the legendary filmmaker behind *Night of the Living Dead* and other classic zombie movies, as a **persistent boss enemy**. In the map, he appears as an undead version of himself, wielding a giant stage light as a weapon and relentlessly pursuing players.

Romero has a massive health pool and can be temporarily pacified by leading him into water or shooting him with a special weapon like the **V-R11**. Killing him yields a power-up, such as a random perk bottle, but he respawns after a few rounds, adding a constant pressure to the game.

### 4. **New Wonder Weapons**
*Call of the Dead* introduces several new and unique Wonder Weapons:
- **V-R11**: This Wonder Weapon can turn zombies back into humans, causing them to run away and explode. It's also critical for completing the Easter egg quest, as it allows players to cure zombies and use them in specific steps.
- **Scavenger**: A sniper rifle that shoots explosive rounds, capable of killing large groups of zombies at once. It's a powerful weapon, especially in the early rounds.
- **Semtex Grenades**: These sticky grenades are new to *Call of the Dead* and are effective at taking out zombies in tightly packed areas.

### 5. **Zip Lines and Flinger**
The map features several interactive elements that make traversal fun and strategic. There are **zip lines** that allow players to quickly move between areas, and a **flinger** that launches players across the map. These mechanics add verticality and mobility to the gameplay, helping players evade zombies and George Romero when necessary.

### 6. **Easter Egg: "Stand-In" and "Ensemble Cast"**
*Call of the Dead* features a multi-step **Easter egg quest** involving Richtofen, who is trapped in a room with the rest of the classic Zombies crew (Dempsey, Nikolai, and Takeo). The player must complete various tasks, such as finding parts and using the V-R11 to help them escape.

Completing the Easter egg unlocks the **Wonder Waffle DG-2**, a classic Wonder Weapon, and advances Richtofen’s storyline as he collects a device known as the **Golden Rod**, which plays a key role in future maps.

### 7. **Challenging Gameplay**
The size and layout of *Call of the Dead* present a significant challenge. The map is large and sprawling, with narrow corridors, open areas for training zombies, and several choke points. Combined with George Romero constantly pursuing players, the map requires careful movement and strategy to survive high rounds.

### 8. **Impact on the Zombies Lore**
While *Call of the Dead* primarily focuses on its unique setting and characters, it still connects to the larger Aether storyline. The Easter egg involving Richtofen collecting the **Golden Rod** is a crucial plot point, and the map serves as a bridge between earlier Zombies maps and the later, more lore-heavy maps in *Black Ops*.

### 9. **Legacy**
*Call of the Dead* is beloved for its fresh take on the Zombies formula, introducing new mechanics, enemies, and a star-studded cast that gave the map a Hollywood feel. The inclusion of George A. Romero as a boss was a loving tribute to the man who defined the modern zombie genre, making the map a fan favorite for both *Call of Duty* and zombie movie fans alike.

It also inspired future maps to experiment with celebrity cameos and large-scale Easter eggs, setting a precedent for more ambitious designs in Zombies mode.

Do you have any favorite moments or strategies for handling George Romero in *Call of the Dead*?

**Shangri-La** is one of the most unique and challenging maps in *Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies*, released as part of the *Annihilation* DLC. Set in an ancient, mysterious jungle temple, *Shangri-La* is known for its intricate layout, punishing difficulty, and vibrant, tropical setting, which is a departure from the darker, more industrial settings of previous maps. Here's a breakdown of what makes **Shangri-La** special:

### 1. **Setting**
*Shangri-La* is set in a lush, overgrown temple deep in the jungle, believed to be an ancient site connected to **Element 115**. The map is filled with exotic plants, waterfalls, and hidden traps, creating an atmosphere that's both beautiful and dangerous. The temple is riddled with puzzles, ancient mechanisms, and secret passageways that challenge players to think strategically as they fend off the zombie horde.

The map’s lore suggests it is located in the Himalayas and has a mystical quality to it, with time travel being one of the central themes.

### 2. **Thematic Design and Atmosphere**
The vibrant jungle environment and temple ruins are unique in the Zombies series. Unlike other maps, *Shangri-La* focuses on the mystical and supernatural, with eerie sculptures, hidden traps, and mysterious artifacts. The map feels alive, with dynamic elements like moving walls, spike traps, and rotating stone pillars that keep players on their toes.

### 3. **New Zombies and Enemies**
*Shangri-La* introduces new, terrifying enemies that add complexity to the gameplay:
- **Napalm Zombie**: This slow-moving zombie bursts into flames upon death, dealing area-of-effect fire damage to nearby players and zombies.
- **Shrieker Zombie**: A fast-moving zombie that emits a loud shriek, blinding and disorienting players. Its speed and ability to stun players make it a dangerous foe in tight spaces.
- **Monkey Bomb Stealers**: Small, quick monkeys that appear after power-ups drop. They attempt to steal the power-ups, but if players kill them, the monkeys can drop random power-ups, including those not normally available on the map, adding a layer of strategy when collecting drops.

### 4. **Wonder Weapons**
*Shangri-La* features two unique Wonder Weapons that enhance the gameplay:
- **31-79 JGb215 (The Shrink Ray)**: This weapon is one of the most creative Wonder Weapons in Zombies history. It shrinks zombies to a tiny size, allowing players to kick them away or trample them. This weapon is essential for completing the Easter egg and is crucial for dealing with large hordes of zombies.
- **Baby Gun** (When Pack-a-Punched): The Shrink Ray can be upgraded to the "Baby Gun," which increases its effectiveness by shrinking zombies in a wider area.

### 5. **Easter Egg: Time Travel Will Tell**
The **Time Travel Will Tell** Easter egg in *Shangri-La* is one of the most complex and multi-step quests in the Zombies series at the time. It involves the use of the Shrink Ray, navigating the map’s many traps, and solving puzzles in different parts of the temple. The Easter egg focuses on helping two trapped explorers escape a time loop in the temple, and it ultimately gives **Richtofen** another key component for his grand plan: the **Focusing Stone**.

Completing the Easter egg requires precise coordination between players and careful use of the map's environmental traps and features, making it a rewarding but difficult challenge.

### 6. **Traps and Map Layout**
*Shangri-La* is notorious for its tight corridors, narrow paths, and numerous environmental traps, which make the map particularly difficult to navigate. Some of these traps include:
- **Spike Traps**: Activated by pressure plates, these spikes shoot out of the ground, damaging players and zombies alike.
- **Mud Pits**: These sections slow down player movement, making it easier for zombies to corner players.
- **Water Slide and Mine Cart**: These elements allow players to quickly travel from one area of the map to another. The water slide is particularly fun but can be dangerous if not used carefully during a zombie chase.

The layout is also challenging due to its many tight spaces, making it hard to run "trains" (a strategy of gathering zombies into a group and running in circles to avoid them). This forces players to rely on teamwork and more tactical movement.

### 7. **Difficulty and Strategy**
*Shangri-La* is widely considered one of the most difficult Zombies maps. The narrow pathways, aggressive special zombies, and dynamic traps create an environment where players must always stay alert. It’s not as easy to survive for long rounds without a coordinated team, and solo runs can be brutal. The key to success is often good communication, map knowledge, and smart use of the Wonder Weapons and traps.

### 8. **Thematic Connection to the Aether Storyline**
Like other Zombies maps, *Shangri-La* is connected to the larger **Aether** storyline involving Richtofen’s quest for control over the Aether and Element 115. The temple is believed to have been a site of Element 115 experimentation, and the Easter egg reveals more about Richtofen’s manipulative plans. His acquisition of the **Focusing Stone** from this map brings him one step closer to his ultimate goal.

### 9. **Impact and Legacy**
*Shangri-La* stands out in the Zombies mode for its bold departure from the traditional settings and its emphasis on environmental hazards and challenging gameplay. While the map can be punishing, it’s also highly rewarding for players who can master its intricacies. The complex Easter egg, the unique Wonder Weapon, and the dynamic environment make it a fan-favorite for those seeking a challenge.

Many players remember *Shangri-La* for its creativity and difficulty, and it remains a nostalgic map for Zombies veterans.

Do you have a favorite memory from playing *Shangri-La*? Or any particular strategies you like to use to survive its intense challenges?


**Moon** is one of the most ambitious and unique Zombies maps in *Call of Duty: Black Ops*, introduced in the *Rezurrection* DLC. It pushed the boundaries of Zombies mode with its innovative mechanics, setting, and game-altering Easter egg, making it a fan-favorite. Here's why **Moon** is so iconic:

### 1. **Setting**
*Moon* is set in two primary locations: the **Area 51** facility on Earth and a secret **Griffin Station** on the moon. Players start in Area 51, which acts as a chaotic prelude where zombies continuously spawn with increasing difficulty until players activate the teleporter to reach the moon.

Once on the moon, the map's eerie atmosphere and low gravity add to the sense of isolation. The map features lunar bases, biodomes, and underground tunnels, all designed to evoke a high-tech, abandoned outpost. The moon's surface is also an open area, where players must deal with low gravity, which dramatically changes movement and combat.

### 2. **New Mechanics**
*Moon* introduced several innovative gameplay mechanics that set it apart from previous maps:
- **Zero Gravity**: Outside Griffin Station, players experience low gravity, allowing for higher jumps and slower falls. This changes how players avoid zombies and traverse the map.
- **Oxygen and PES**: Because the moon has no atmosphere, players need to wear a **PES (Pressure Equalization Suit)** helmet to survive in certain areas. If the player removes the helmet in an area without air, they start taking damage. This adds an extra layer of challenge, as some rooms can have their oxygen supply cut off by zombie attacks.
- **Teleportation**: Players must teleport from Area 51 to the moon at the start of the game, and they can teleport back to Area 51 to access the **Pack-a-Punch** machine. However, returning to Area 51 is risky because zombies spawn endlessly there, and the round difficulty progresses while you're on the moon.

### 3. **Wave-like Spawning in Area 51**
The Area 51 starting area is a chaotic, never-ending round where zombies and Hellhounds spawn endlessly. The round counter doesn't start until you teleport to the moon, making it a fun but dangerous area to survive as long as possible. This area also has **Juggernog** and **Speed Cola** perk machines, but they are randomized each time you return.

### 4. **New Enemies**
*Moon* introduced new enemies to keep players on edge:
- **Astronaut Zombie**: This enemy looks like a regular astronaut but has a unique and frustrating ability—when it grabs a player, it teleports them to a random part of the map and removes one of their perks. The astronaut zombie is tough to kill and keeps players constantly alert.
- **Crawlers (Phasing Zombies)**: These small, fast zombies can teleport and phase in and out of reality, making them hard to hit and a constant nuisance in tight areas.

### 5. **Wonder Weapons**
*Moon* brought back some fan-favorite Wonder Weapons while introducing new ones:
- **Wave Gun**: The Wave Gun is a dual-purpose Wonder Weapon that can be separated into two handheld **Zap Guns** or combined to form a single powerful weapon. When in Wave Gun form, it causes zombies to expand and explode, making it one of the most fun and devastating weapons in the game.
- **QED (Quantum Entanglement Device)**: A grenade-like device with unpredictable effects, the QED can help or harm players. It can spawn weapons, perks, or even kill zombies, but it can also hurt players, spawn more zombies, or activate traps.
- **Gersh Device**: Returning from *Ascension*, the Gersh Device acts as a black hole grenade, pulling in zombies and killing them instantly.

### 6. **The Easter Egg: "Richtofen’s Grand Scheme"**
*Moon* features one of the most important and game-changing Easter eggs in Zombies history. The **"Richtofen’s Grand Scheme"** Easter egg follows Richtofen's plan to swap souls with **Samantha Maxis**, the girl who controls the zombies. To do this, players must complete a complex series of steps involving the **Golden Rod** (from *Call of the Dead*), the **Wave Gun**, the **QED**, and other tasks scattered throughout the map.

Once completed, Richtofen successfully transfers his soul into Samantha's body, gaining control of the zombies. However, **Dr. Maxis** activates **Griffin Station's missiles**, sending them to Earth and causing a **nuclear explosion** that destroys the planet’s surface. This massive event changes the entire Zombies storyline and marks one of the most pivotal moments in the series' lore.

### 7. **High Replayability**
*Moon* is beloved for its unique combination of chaotic combat, tight spaces, and wide-open moon surfaces. The **Pack-a-Punch** machine is located in Area 51, adding risk to getting upgrades, as players must teleport back and forth between Earth and the moon to access it. Additionally, the introduction of **low gravity** changes movement and makes dodging zombies both fun and challenging.

### 8. **Influence on Zombies Lore**
The events of *Moon* are critical to the overarching Aether storyline. Richtofen’s successful body swap and control over the zombies set the stage for future maps, and the destruction of Earth plays a major role in the storyline of later maps like *Transit* and *Buried*. The Easter egg cemented Richtofen as one of the central figures in the Zombies universe, leading to further power struggles in later games.

### 9. **Legacy**
*Moon* is remembered for its groundbreaking mechanics, innovative setting, and impactful storyline. It remains one of the most complex and engaging maps due to the combination of low gravity, the oxygen mechanic, and the demanding Easter egg. The mix of survival horror and sci-fi, coupled with the significant lore revelations, makes it a fan-favorite.

Whether you're trying to survive the endless chaos of Area 51, dealing with the unpredictable astronaut zombie, or completing Richtofen's Easter egg, *Moon* offers a unique and intense experience.

Do you have any memorable moments from playing *Moon* or favorite strategies to deal with its unique challenges?


**Tranzit** is one of the most polarizing Zombies maps in *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*. Released with the base game, it introduced ambitious new features, including a massive open-world-like environment, a bus system for transportation, and a complex Easter egg. Despite its mixed reception, **Tranzit** remains a memorable part of the Zombies experience for its unique ideas and challenging gameplay. Here’s a breakdown of what makes **Tranzit** stand out:

### 1. **Setting and Structure**
*Tranzit* takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting filled with fog, lava, and destroyed buildings. It is set in a large, interconnected world made up of five main areas:
- **Bus Depot**
- **Diner**
- **Farm**
- **Power Station**
- **Town**

These areas are connected by roads, and the player can travel between them either on foot or by using the **bus**, which is one of the map's signature features. The entire map is open from the start, and players must navigate the dangerous areas in between the major locations, which are filled with fog and lava that can damage and slow them down.

### 2. **Bus System**
One of *Tranzit*'s most iconic mechanics is the **bus**, driven by the robotic character **T.E.D.D.**. The bus provides safe (but temporary) transportation between the different areas of the map. It’s fortified with metal barriers, but zombies can still jump onto the bus and attack players. Players must decide when to ride the bus or risk being stranded if they miss it, which adds a dynamic element of strategy.

While the bus is a novel idea, its slow speed and limited protection make it both a blessing and a curse, forcing players to manage their time wisely and plan their routes around its movements.

### 3. **New Buildables and Equipment**
*Tranzit* introduced **buildable items**, which are essential for surviving and navigating the map:
- **Turbine**: A portable power generator that players can use to open doors or power objects without activating the main power station. It's especially useful early on but can break after a while.
- **Zombie Shield**: A melee weapon that players can strap on their backs to block zombie attacks from behind.
- **Jet Gun**: A Wonder Weapon that players can build by collecting parts from different areas of the map. However, the Jet Gun is fragile and can break if overused, forcing players to repair it often.

These buildables require players to explore the entire map to gather parts, which adds an exploration element but can feel cumbersome due to the large map size and dangers present between areas.

### 4. **New Zombies and Hazards**
*Tranzit* introduced several new enemies and environmental hazards:
- **Denizens**: These small, annoying creatures spawn in the fog-covered areas between locations. They jump on players' heads, obscuring vision and dealing damage. To avoid Denizens, players must stick to well-lit areas or use the bus.
- **Lava and Fire**: Scattered throughout the map are pools of lava, and crossing them causes fire damage to players and zombies. Lava also causes zombies to explode when killed, adding more danger to close-quarters combat.
- **Avogadro**: A new boss-like enemy, the **Avogadro**, spawns after players turn on the power. It's an electrical zombie that can teleport and deal damage with electric attacks, making it a tough foe to deal with.

### 5. **Pack-a-Punch and Power**
Accessing the **Pack-a-Punch machine** in *Tranzit* is one of the most complex tasks in Zombies mode. Players must first turn on the power at the **Power Station**, then collect specific parts to open the Pack-a-Punch room, which is hidden underneath the **Town**. This process is time-consuming and requires cooperation and coordination among players.

Similarly, turning on the power is not straightforward, as players need to explore the Power Station and build the switch to activate it. Once the power is on, electrical hazards and the Avogadro can start appearing, adding to the challenge.

### 6. **The Easter Egg: Tower of Babble**
*Tranzit* features a **major Easter egg quest** called **"Tower of Babble"**, which can be completed in two different ways, depending on whether players side with **Dr. Maxis** or **Richtofen**:
- **Maxis's Path**: Involves destroying the **Avogadro** using turbines and activating electrical towers.
- **Richtofen's Path**: Requires the use of EMP grenades to stop the Avogadro from completing Maxis's plan.

The Easter egg is intricate and difficult, requiring teamwork and precise timing, but it furthers the ongoing Aether storyline, continuing the rivalry between Maxis and Richtofen.

### 7. **Challenges and Criticism**
Despite its innovative ideas, *Tranzit* received mixed reviews, largely due to its **difficulty** and the punishing mechanics:
- The **fog** that covers the areas between locations makes it hard to see and forces players to fight Denizens constantly.
- **Lava** and fire hazards are scattered throughout the map, causing frequent damage and slowing down movement.
- The **large size** of the map and reliance on the bus make navigation slow and often frustrating, especially when players get stranded between areas.
- **Buildables**, while a neat concept, can feel tedious to collect, as they are scattered across the vast map.

While some players appreciated the map's ambitious open-world design, others felt that it made gameplay too slow and cumbersome compared to more focused maps like *Kino der Toten* or *Ascension*.

### 8. **Impact on Zombies Lore**
*Tranzit* plays a key role in the ongoing Zombies storyline, introducing **"The Victis Crew"**: **Misty, Marlton, Russman, and Samuel Stuhlinger**. This crew becomes important in subsequent maps (*Die Rise*, *Buried*) as the struggle between **Maxis** and **Richtofen** escalates. Stuhlinger, in particular, hears the voice of Richtofen, which influences the crew's actions in future maps.

The *Tower of Babble* Easter egg is the beginning of a larger narrative about the race to control Earth's remaining survivors and energy after the events of *Moon* and Earth's destruction.

### 9. **Legacy**
*Tranzit* remains one of the most debated maps in Zombies history. While its innovative design and mechanics were bold, they also made it one of the most frustrating and difficult maps to play. For some, it represents a creative step forward in Zombies, while for others, it is seen as overly ambitious and flawed.

In later Zombies experiences, such as *Black Ops III* and *Cold War*, maps took lessons from *Tranzit*’s open-world concept and refined them to create smoother, more manageable experiences. There are rumors and desires within the Zombies community for a remastered version of *Tranzit* without the fog and Denizens, which could address many of the map's original criticisms.

### Final Thoughts
*Tranzit* is an ambitious and experimental map that tried to redefine what Zombies could be. Its interconnected world, complex mechanics, and challenging environment make it a memorable experience, though not without its frustrations. For players who enjoy exploration and long-term strategy, *Tranzit* offers a unique and intense Zombies experience.

Do you have any memorable experiences or frustrations with *Tranzit*? How do you feel about its difficulty and mechanics?


**Die Rise** is a Zombies map from *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*, released as part of the *Revolution* DLC. Set in a crumbling skyscraper complex in post-apocalyptic China, *Die Rise* is known for its verticality, tight spaces, and disorienting map layout. It builds on *Tranzit's* experimental style but focuses more on vertical movement, dangerous ledges, and environmental hazards. Here’s what makes **Die Rise** stand out:

### 1. **Setting**
*Die Rise* takes place in a series of collapsed skyscrapers that have fallen over one another. This creates a chaotic and disorienting environment with both horizontal and vertical navigation. Players must traverse broken floors, jump between buildings, and descend elevator shafts, making it one of the most unique and challenging settings in Zombies mode.

The map is located in a dense urban area, with tight, claustrophobic hallways and perilous drops everywhere. It’s easy for players to fall to their deaths if they’re not careful, adding an extra layer of danger to navigating the map.

### 2. **Vertical Layout**
One of *Die Rise*'s defining features is its **vertical layout**. Unlike most Zombies maps that are primarily horizontal, *Die Rise* requires players to navigate multiple floors of crumbling buildings, often having to drop down from one level to another. This creates a sense of verticality and adds complexity to the movement, as players need to find elevators, broken staircases, or jumps to move between areas.

The map’s confusing layout, with its twisting hallways and dead-ends, makes it easy to get lost or trapped. It's not uncommon for players to accidentally fall off the edge while running from zombies, leading to frustrating deaths.

### 3. **Elevators**
The **elevators** in *Die Rise* are both a blessing and a curse. They serve multiple purposes:
- **Perk-a-Cola Machines**: The elevators often carry the perk machines, such as Juggernog and Speed Cola, but their locations are constantly changing, as the elevators move up and down throughout the game.
- **Transportation**: Players can ride elevators between floors, but they must time their rides carefully. If an elevator drops without warning, players can fall to their deaths. Additionally, some elevators can crush players if they are standing in the wrong spot.

This mechanic adds an unpredictable element to the gameplay, as players must keep track of where their essential perks and upgrades are and time their movements to access them safely.

### 4. **New Wonder Weapon: The Sliquifier**
One of the standout features of *Die Rise* is the introduction of the **Sliquifier**, a Wonder Weapon that shoots a purple liquid that causes zombies to slip and slide, spreading damage across groups. The liquid can chain between zombies, making it highly effective at taking down large hordes in confined spaces.

However, the Sliquifier's slippery liquid can also affect players, so using it requires careful planning. If players aren’t cautious, they can slip on the liquid themselves, which can be especially deadly in a map filled with ledges and drop-offs.

### 5. **Buildables**
Like other maps in *Black Ops II*, *Die Rise* includes **buildable items**:
- **The Trample Steam**: This is a springboard device that can fling players across gaps, allowing them to reach areas that are otherwise inaccessible. It can also be used to launch zombies off the map, making it a useful defensive tool in certain areas.

The Trample Steam is key to navigating the map efficiently, as some jumps are impossible to make without it. Players must carefully place it and time their jumps to avoid falling to their deaths.

### 6. **The Nova Crawlers**
*Die Rise* features a variant of the **Nova Crawlers** from previous maps. These small, fast zombies explode when killed, leaving a damaging gas cloud behind. They spawn during specific rounds and are more of a nuisance than a major threat, but their ability to blind and disorient players in the map's tight spaces makes them dangerous in large numbers.

### 7. **Perilous Drops and Environmental Hazards**
Falling to your death is one of the most common hazards in *Die Rise*. The map is filled with narrow ledges, broken floors, and massive gaps between buildings. One wrong step or an accidental slip can result in instant death, which adds a layer of difficulty unlike any other Zombies map.

The **falling hazard** is a key aspect of the map's challenge. Players need to be constantly aware of their surroundings, especially when running from zombies or using powerful weapons that could push them off the edge.

### 8. **The Easter Egg: High Maintenance**
The **High Maintenance** Easter egg in *Die Rise* is a complex, multi-step quest that continues the ongoing conflict between **Dr. Maxis** and **Richtofen**. Similar to the Easter egg in *Tranzit*, players can complete the quest for either Maxis or Richtofen, depending on which side they choose.

The Easter egg involves a series of tasks that require teamwork, such as lighting up specific symbols and using the Sliquifier to shoot targets. The reward for completing the Easter egg varies depending on the side chosen, and it furthers the Zombies storyline, which would later culminate in maps like *Buried* and *Origins*.

### 9. **Gameplay Challenges and Strategies**
*Die Rise* is considered a **challenging** map due to its confusing layout, vertical hazards, and the unpredictability of the elevators. Players must be extremely careful when navigating the map, as it's easy to get separated from teammates or trapped in a dead-end.

Effective strategies often involve using **Trample Steams** and **Sliquifier** to control zombie hordes in tight spaces. Players need to stick together and communicate, especially when dealing with the constantly moving elevators that house the perk machines.

Because the map is so vertical, finding a good spot to run **zombie trains** (grouping zombies together and running in circles to avoid them) can be difficult. The **Buddha Room**, located in the middle of the map, is a popular spot for running trains due to its open space and lack of falling hazards.

### 10. **Reception and Legacy**
*Die Rise* has a mixed reception among Zombies players. Some appreciate the map's innovative verticality and unique mechanics, while others find the navigation confusing and the falling hazards frustrating. The difficulty of mastering *Die Rise* makes it a rewarding experience for skilled players, but newcomers often struggle with its steep learning curve.

Despite its polarizing nature, *Die Rise* is remembered for its ambition and creativity. It built on the experimentation of *Tranzit* but offered a more focused experience, with tighter, more claustrophobic gameplay and an emphasis on vertical movement. The **Sliquifier** is also considered one of the most fun and effective Wonder Weapons in the Zombies series.

### Final Thoughts
*Die Rise* is a challenging and innovative Zombies map that took the series in a new direction with its vertical gameplay and deadly environmental hazards. While its difficulty may frustrate some players, others enjoy the thrill of mastering its layout and surviving the perilous skyscrapers. Whether you love or hate it, *Die Rise* is undeniably a unique and memorable part of the *Call of Duty Zombies* experience.

Do you enjoy the verticality of *Die Rise*, or do you find the environmental hazards too punishing? What's your favorite strategy when playing the map?

**Buried** is a fan-favorite Zombies map from *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*, released as part of the *Vengeance* DLC. Set in an underground Old West-style town, *Buried* offers a blend of nostalgic aesthetics, innovative mechanics, and one of the more accessible layouts compared to earlier maps like *Tranzit* and *Die Rise*. It is known for its unique atmosphere, the introduction of new characters, and its final showdown in the **Maxis vs. Richtofen** storyline. Here’s what makes **Buried** so special:

### 1. **Setting**
*Buried* is set in a mysterious underground town located beneath a modern-day mining site. The town has a Western theme, with saloons, shops, and a courthouse, all lit by lanterns and surrounded by eerie, foggy caverns. This underground setting creates a claustrophobic but also oddly cozy atmosphere. The map is much more straightforward and less punishing than *Die Rise* or *Tranzit*, which makes it a fan favorite for players who enjoy more relaxed Zombies gameplay.

### 2. **Leroy (The Giant)**
One of the most unique mechanics in *Buried* is the introduction of **Leroy** (also called **The Giant**). Leroy is a large, gentle giant imprisoned in a cell near the spawn. Once freed, he helps players in various ways:
- **Smashing Barriers**: Leroy can be led to blockades or debris by giving him candy or booze, and he'll clear pathways for the players. This makes it easier to access parts of the map and essential perks or weapons.
- **Carrying Items**: He can also carry parts for buildables or help players defend specific locations when given candy.

Leroy becomes a crucial part of map progression, adding a new layer of strategy and resource management. Players must manage his behavior and keep him on their side, as damaging him causes him to run back to his cell, requiring players to free him again.

### 3. **New Weapons: Ray Gun Mark II**
*Buried* introduced the **Ray Gun Mark II**, an upgraded version of the classic **Ray Gun**. The Mark II fires a three-round burst of energy rounds that can penetrate multiple zombies, making it highly effective in high rounds. It became a beloved weapon due to its increased damage output and reduced splash damage compared to the original Ray Gun.

Other notable weapons in *Buried* include the **Paralyzer**, a Wonder Weapon that slows down and eventually kills zombies by suspending them in the air. The Paralyzer has infinite ammo, but it can overheat if used continuously, forcing players to manage its cooldown.

### 4. **The Maze and Haunted Mansion**
As players explore *Buried*, they eventually come across the **Haunted Mansion**, home to ghostly figures called **Witches**. The witches act as a unique enemy type that doesn't directly kill players but can **steal points** with every hit they land. Players must navigate through the mansion to access the **Pack-a-Punch** machine, but every visit comes with the risk of losing valuable points.

Beyond the mansion lies a **maze**, which changes layout each game and must be navigated to reach the Pack-a-Punch machine. This adds a layer of unpredictability, requiring players to carefully manage their resources and plan their trips through the mansion and maze.

### 5. **New Perk: Vulture Aid**
*Buried* introduced **Vulture Aid**, a new perk that gives players additional ways to gather resources:
- It reveals nearby item locations, including perks and weapons, through icons that appear on-screen.
- When zombies are killed, they sometimes drop **small piles of ammo or points**, which players can collect for a quick boost.
- Killing zombies also causes them to emit green mist, which players can stand in to become temporarily invisible to other zombies, offering a unique way to escape danger.

This perk is particularly helpful for surviving in the later rounds, as it makes resource management much easier by providing a steady stream of ammo and points.

### 6. **Buildables**
Like earlier maps, *Buried* features several **buildable items**, which players can construct to aid their survival:
- **Subsurface Resonator**: A powerful sonic weapon that can kill large groups of zombies when paired with the **Turbine** (a portable power source).
- **Head Chopper**: A stationary blade trap that slices zombies as they pass through.
- **Trample Steam**: Returns from *Die Rise*, allowing players to launch zombies and themselves across gaps.

These buildables can be strategically placed around the map to help control zombie waves and defend key locations.

### 7. **Easter Egg: Mined Games**
The **Mined Games** Easter egg is the culmination of the storyline conflict between **Richtofen** and **Maxis**. Players can choose to complete the quest for either character, furthering the narrative that has been building across several maps.

- **Richtofen's Side**: Involves powering up devices around the map and completing various steps to transfer Richtofen’s consciousness into **Samuel Stuhlinger**, allowing Richtofen to gain control of the zombies.
- **Maxis's Side**: Involves destroying **Richtofen’s** devices and activating a series of beacons to aid **Maxis** in his plan to control the Aether and stop Richtofen.

Completing either side of the Easter egg affects the broader storyline and sets the stage for the next map, *Origins*. The Easter egg in *Buried* is considered one of the more accessible quests compared to earlier maps like *Tranzit*, and players can unlock powerful rewards along the way.

### 8. **The Pack-a-Punch Machine**
To access the **Pack-a-Punch** machine, players must travel through the Haunted Mansion and navigate the maze. The witches guarding the mansion make it difficult, as they drain points with each hit. However, after defeating the witches, players are rewarded with a **free perk** for surviving. The challenge of reaching the Pack-a-Punch machine makes it one of the most memorable features of *Buried*.

### 9. **Map Design and Strategy**
Compared to maps like *Tranzit* and *Die Rise*, *Buried* is considered more **beginner-friendly** due to its open layout and clear progression. The map offers plenty of space for running **zombie trains** (grouping zombies together and running in circles to avoid them), and the help from Leroy makes it easier to control zombie flow and open up new areas.

That said, *Buried* can still be challenging in the later rounds, especially with the tight corridors in the mansion and the unpredictable maze. Players often use the **Juggernog** room or the **saloon** as prime spots for running trains or setting up defenses with buildables like the **Subsurface Resonator**.

### 10. **Reception and Legacy**
*Buried* is widely loved for its atmosphere, unique mechanics, and balance of accessibility and challenge. The map’s Western theme, combined with the mystery of the underground town, gives it a distinct flavor that sets it apart from other Zombies maps. The interactions with Leroy, the addition of Vulture Aid, and the layout of the Haunted Mansion make it a map that offers both fun and strategy.

For many, *Buried* is one of the highlights of *Black Ops II Zombies*, offering a more casual yet still rewarding experience compared to some of the more complex maps like *Die Rise*. Its Easter egg plays a key role in the ongoing Zombies storyline and has helped solidify *Buried* as a significant chapter in the Aether narrative.

### Final Thoughts
*Buried* is an innovative and nostalgic map that balances fun and strategy, offering a unique blend of Western aesthetics, creative gameplay mechanics, and an engaging Easter egg. Its mix of manageable difficulty, interesting locations, and Leroy's helpful abilities make it a beloved part of *Black Ops II Zombies*.

Do you enjoy the unique mechanics of *Buried*, or do you prefer the more complex maps like *Die Rise* or *Tranzit*?


**Mob of the Dead** is one of the most critically acclaimed and beloved Zombies maps from *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*, released as part of the *Uprising* DLC. Set in **Alcatraz Prison** during the Prohibition era, the map features a dark and eerie atmosphere, a unique storyline separate from the main **Aether** saga, and several innovative gameplay mechanics. Here's what makes **Mob of the Dead** so iconic:

### 1. **Setting: Alcatraz Prison**
*Mob of the Dead* takes place in a twisted version of **Alcatraz**, the infamous maximum-security prison located on an island in San Francisco Bay. The map is steeped in dark, gothic horror, featuring narrow prison cells, dark hallways, and foggy outdoor areas. The grim setting contributes to a claustrophobic atmosphere, enhanced by a haunting soundtrack and environmental storytelling.

This version of Alcatraz is overrun by zombies, with a supernatural twist that plays a significant role in the map's narrative. The prison is littered with references to death, madness, and punishment, creating an immersive and nightmarish experience for players.

### 2. **New Cast of Characters**
*Mob of the Dead* introduces four new characters, all based on mobsters from the Prohibition era. Each character is voiced by a famous actor:
- **Albert "The Weasel" Arlington** (voiced by Joe Pantoliano)
- **Billy Handsome** (voiced by Ray Liotta)
- **Salvatore "Sal" DeLuca** (voiced by Chazz Palminteri)
- **Michael "Finn" O'Leary** (voiced by Michael Madsen)

These mobsters are trapped in a cycle of purgatory, forced to relive their deaths in Alcatraz as they attempt to escape. The characters have distinct personalities and dialogue, which adds depth to the story and makes *Mob of the Dead* feel like a cinematic experience.

### 3. **The Afterlife Mechanic**
One of the most innovative features in *Mob of the Dead* is the **Afterlife** mechanic. At the start of the game, each player can enter **Afterlife Mode** upon death, becoming a ghost-like entity that can interact with parts of the map and solve puzzles. While in Afterlife, players can:
- Revive themselves.
- Power up various switches and open doors.
- Access hidden areas that are otherwise unreachable.
- Defeat enemies while in this state.

This mechanic adds a unique twist to the typical Zombies formula, forcing players to strategically manage their deaths and use the Afterlife to solve puzzles and progress through the map. Players can deliberately enter Afterlife by using **electric chairs** or dying, and they have a limited amount of time to achieve their objectives before returning to their bodies.

### 4. **The Plane and Escape Plan**
A central goal in *Mob of the Dead* is to **build a plane** to escape Alcatraz. Players must collect various parts scattered around the prison, and use Afterlife mode to unlock certain areas. Once all parts are collected and the plane is assembled, players can fly the plane to the **Golden Gate Bridge**, which acts as a secondary area where they can access the **Pack-a-Punch machine**.

However, escaping on the plane isn’t the end of the map. After reaching the bridge, players return to Alcatraz and must repeat the process, as they are trapped in a cycle of death and escape attempts. This thematic repetition ties into the story’s purgatorial nature, where the characters are doomed to relive their deaths.

### 5. **New Wonder Weapons: The Blundergat and Acid Gat**
*Mob of the Dead* introduced several powerful Wonder Weapons:
- **Blundergat**: A hybrid shotgun that functions as a single-shot, high-damage weapon, combining the lethality of a blunderbuss with a modern shotgun. It’s one of the most iconic weapons in Zombies history.
- **Acid Gat**: The Blundergat can be upgraded into the **Acid Gat** using the **Acid Kit**. The Acid Gat fires explosive acid rounds that stick to zombies and explode after a short delay, making it highly effective for crowd control.

The Blundergat can also be upgraded via the **Pack-a-Punch** machine to become the **Vitriolic Withering**, an even more powerful version of the Acid Gat.

### 6. **Hell's Retriever**
Another standout weapon in *Mob of the Dead* is the **Hell’s Retriever**, a fiery, boomerang-like tomahawk that players can throw to kill multiple zombies and retrieve drops from a distance. Players can acquire the Hell’s Retriever by completing a side quest involving feeding three **Hellhounds** that spawn in different areas of the map.

The Hell’s Retriever can be further upgraded to **Hell’s Redeemer**, which is even more powerful and can be charged to deal more damage and return faster.

### 7. **Brutus: The Warden**
*Mob of the Dead* introduces a new boss zombie, **Brutus**, also known as **The Warden**. Brutus is a powerful and relentless enemy who spawns periodically throughout the game to hunt down players. He can:
- Lock down Perk-a-Cola machines and the **Mystery Box**, forcing players to pay to unlock them.
- Deal massive damage to players and absorb a large amount of gunfire before being killed.

Brutus adds a layer of challenge, as players must manage resources and stay alert while defending against him, especially when he locks down key equipment or areas.

### 8. **The Easter Egg: Pop Goes the Weasel**
The **"Pop Goes the Weasel"** Easter egg in *Mob of the Dead* is one of the most memorable and story-driven Easter eggs in Zombies history. It revolves around the cyclical purgatory that the characters are trapped in, with a twist: **Weasel**, one of the mobsters, knew about the cycle and attempted to escape, only to be killed by the others in a betrayal.

The Easter egg involves a series of steps that ultimately lead to a final showdown on the **Golden Gate Bridge**, where players can either:
- Side with Weasel and attempt to kill the other players to break the cycle.
- Side with the mobsters and kill Weasel to maintain the cycle.

Depending on the outcome, either Weasel escapes and breaks free, or the cycle continues, trapping the mobsters in their endless purgatory. This moral choice and its implications give the Easter egg a unique narrative weight and depth.

### 9. **Atmosphere and Storytelling**
The dark, moody atmosphere of *Mob of the Dead* is one of its strongest points. The prison’s haunted, decrepit appearance, combined with the isolation of being stuck on an island surrounded by water, adds a constant feeling of dread. The soundtrack, which includes haunting music and sound effects, heightens this atmosphere, making players feel like they’re truly trapped in a prison of the undead.

The story of *Mob of the Dead* is also one of the most well-developed in Zombies history. The tale of betrayal, guilt, and punishment adds an emotional layer to the otherwise chaotic gameplay, and the mobster characters, with their distinct personalities and tragic backstories, make the map feel like more than just a survival experience.

### 10. **Legacy**
*Mob of the Dead* is widely regarded as one of the best Zombies maps of all time, thanks to its blend of innovative mechanics, atmospheric storytelling, and engaging Easter egg. It influenced future maps like **Blood of the Dead** in *Call of Duty: Black Ops 4*, which revisits the Alcatraz setting and incorporates the classic **Primis** crew into the storyline.

For many Zombies fans, *Mob of the Dead* represents the perfect balance between accessibility and depth, with its unique mechanics like Afterlife mode and its tightly woven narrative. It remains a standout map in the *Black Ops II* Zombies experience.

### Final Thoughts
*Mob of the Dead* is a masterclass in Zombies map design, combining an iconic setting, innovative mechanics, and a rich, emotional story. Whether it’s the dynamic gameplay of Afterlife mode, the powerful Wonder Weapons like the Blundergat, or the eerie atmosphere of Alcatraz itself, *Mob of the Dead* offers a truly unforgettable experience.

Do you have any favorite memories from *Mob of the Dead*, or did you enjoy the unique storyline and its dark themes?


**Origins** is one of the most beloved and ambitious Zombies maps in *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*, released as part of the *Apocalypse* DLC. It's the final map in the **Aether storyline** of *Black Ops II* and introduces new gameplay mechanics, deepens the Zombies lore, and features the **Primis crew** in their original, youthful forms. Here's why **Origins** is considered a fan-favorite and a defining map in the Zombies series:

### 1. **Setting: World War I, France**
*Origins* is set in a World War I battlefield in northern France, during an alternate history where **Element 115** is being mined and experimented with, leading to the creation of the undead. The map combines war-torn trenches, bunkers, and a large excavation site, giving it a gritty and bleak atmosphere.

This war setting is unique in Zombies and adds a historical element to the map, mixing real-world events with the Zombies’ alternate timeline. The **Giant Robots** that patrol the map and the advanced technology discovered by **Group 935** create a fascinating mix of old-world warfare and sci-fi elements.

### 2. **Return of the Primis Crew**
*Origins* brings back the **Primis crew**—**Tank Dempsey**, **Nikolai Belinski**, **Takeo Masaki**, and **Edward Richtofen**—but in their younger forms. These versions of the characters are less battle-hardened and more focused on their missions, with Richtofen still working on his sinister plans involving **Element 115**.

This map marks the beginning of the **Primis** storyline, which would continue in future games, with these four characters playing pivotal roles in the fight for control of the **Aether**. Their dialogue and interactions in *Origins* set the stage for their future development, making this map essential to understanding the broader Zombies lore.

### 3. **New Gameplay Mechanics**
*Origins* introduced several groundbreaking mechanics that have since become staples in Zombies mode:
- **Giant Robots (The Iron Giants)**: Massive robots patrol the map, stepping over the trenches and crushing anything in their path. Players must carefully avoid being crushed by these robots as they move across the battlefield. Additionally, players can enter the robots' heads by accessing specific spots on the map, where they must complete certain tasks for the **Easter egg**.
- **Elemental Staffs**: One of the map's core features is the creation of the **four Elemental Staffs**—powerful Wonder Weapons based on fire, ice, wind, and lightning. Players must collect parts scattered across the map and complete puzzles to build and upgrade these staffs. Each staff has unique abilities, and upgrading them makes them even more powerful. The staffs are essential for surviving high rounds and completing the Easter egg.
- **Crazy Place**: This is a mysterious, otherworldly area accessed via teleporters around the map. Players must visit the Crazy Place to collect parts for the Elemental Staffs. The location is filled with shifting platforms and elemental traps, adding a layer of complexity and danger to the gameplay.

### 4. **The New Wonder Weapon: The Elemental Staffs**
The **Elemental Staffs** are among the most iconic Wonder Weapons in Zombies history. Each staff has its own unique power and can be upgraded into a more powerful version:
- **Fire Staff (Kagutsuchi's Blood)**: Shoots explosive fireballs that incinerate zombies.
- **Ice Staff (Ull's Arrow)**: Freezes zombies in place, allowing players to shatter them easily.
- **Wind Staff (Boreas' Fury)**: Creates wind blasts that blow zombies away.
- **Lightning Staff (Kimat's Bite)**: Shoots bolts of lightning that chain through groups of zombies.

Once upgraded, these staffs become crucial tools for both offense and defense, and they play a significant role in the Easter egg quest. Players must master their use to progress through the map and survive the increasingly difficult rounds.

### 5. **Panzer Soldat**
One of the toughest enemies introduced in *Origins* is the **Panzer Soldat**, a heavily armored zombie equipped with a flamethrower and claw arm that can pull players toward it. The Panzer Soldat spawns periodically and adds a significant challenge to the map, as it takes a lot of firepower to take down. Its presence forces players to stay alert, especially in the early rounds when weapons are weaker.

### 6. **Generators and Power System**
Instead of the traditional power switch, *Origins* uses **Generators** to activate power in specific areas of the map. There are six generators scattered across the battlefield, and players must activate each one by standing near it and defending it from zombie attacks. Once a generator is powered up, players can access perks and Pack-a-Punch in that area.

This system adds a layer of strategy, as players must manage their resources and decide which generators to activate first. Zombies also occasionally attempt to disable generators, forcing players to defend them throughout the game.

### 7. **The Easter Egg: Little Lost Girl**
The **Little Lost Girl** Easter egg in *Origins* is one of the most elaborate and important Easter eggs in the Zombies storyline. The quest revolves around **Samantha Maxis**, who is trapped in **Agartha**, the mythical realm that exists outside time and space. Players must complete a series of challenging tasks, including upgrading the Elemental Staffs, solving puzzles, and navigating the Crazy Place to free Samantha.

The Easter egg culminates with the players sending the Primis crew into Agartha, where they save Samantha and secure the **Focusing Stone**. This event is crucial to the Zombies storyline and leads directly into the events of *Black Ops III*, where the fight for control of the Aether continues.

### 8. **Zombie Blood and Other Power-Ups**
*Origins* introduced a new power-up called **Zombie Blood**, which temporarily makes players invisible to zombies. This allows them to navigate the map safely or complete certain tasks without being attacked. It’s a useful tool for surviving in tight situations or reviving downed teammates.

In addition to Zombie Blood, *Origins* brought back classic power-ups like **Insta-Kill**, **Max Ammo**, and **Double Points**, all of which are essential for managing the map’s increasing difficulty.

### 9. **Map Design and Strategy**
*Origins* is a large and complex map, filled with trenches, tunnels, and wide-open areas. It requires players to balance exploration with survival, as many areas of the map are vital for collecting parts and progressing through the Easter egg. The **Juggernog** and **Pack-a-Punch** machines are spread out, so players need to plan their movements carefully.

One of the most effective strategies is to run **zombie trains** in the wide-open trenches, which allows players to gather large groups of zombies and take them out efficiently. The use of **G-Strike Beacons** (another special equipment item) and the **Maxis Drone** (a buildable helper drone) also play key roles in defending against zombies and completing objectives.

### 10. **Legacy and Reception**
*Origins* is widely considered one of the best Zombies maps ever made due to its combination of deep lore, innovative gameplay mechanics, and a perfect balance of challenge and fun. The map introduced mechanics that became iconic in later Zombies maps, such as the Elemental Wonder Weapons and boss-like enemies like the Panzer Soldat.

The story of **Primis** also begins here, laying the groundwork for the next phase of the Aether storyline in *Black Ops III*. The emotional depth of the Easter egg, which revolves around saving Samantha Maxis and the crew’s journey to Agartha, resonated with many fans, making it one of the most impactful narratives in Zombies history.

### Final Thoughts
*Origins* is a defining map in the Zombies series, offering a rich blend of challenging gameplay, innovative mechanics, and deep lore. From the introduction of the Elemental Staffs to the iconic Panzer Soldat, every aspect of *Origins* feels finely tuned for a memorable experience. Its impact on the overall Zombies storyline is immense, and it remains a go-to map for players who enjoy high-level strategies and engaging Easter egg quests.

What’s your favorite part of *Origins*? Do you enjoy the challenge of the Elemental Staffs or the epic Easter egg quest to free Samantha?


**Shadows of Evil** is the launch Zombies map for *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*, and it introduced players to the new **Aether storyline** known as the **Apocalypse** arc. Set in a 1940s noir-style city filled with supernatural elements, *Shadows of Evil* is known for its intricate map design, deep lore, and gameplay innovations. It’s a map that combined the complexity of previous Zombies maps with fresh ideas that set the stage for *Black Ops III’s* Zombies mode.

Here’s what makes **Shadows of Evil** a standout map:

### 1. **Setting: Morg City**
*Shadows of Evil* is set in the fictional **Morg City**, a dark, rainy, and noir-inspired city reminiscent of classic 1940s crime thrillers. The city is filled with jazz clubs, casinos, theaters, and alleyways, and features a heavy supernatural influence. The map's design and atmosphere are highly immersive, blending elements of horror and film noir with a sinister, otherworldly twist.

Morg City is heavily influenced by the Lovecraftian aesthetic, with strange symbols, creatures, and an underlying cosmic horror theme. The city’s setting perfectly complements the map’s story of four characters who are each tied to dark deeds and must atone for their sins.

### 2. **The Apothicons and Lovecraftian Horror**
*Shadows of Evil* introduces the **Apothicons**, ancient cosmic beings tied to the destruction of the universe, as the primary antagonists. Their influence on Morg City is evident in the strange symbols, monstrous creatures, and rituals found throughout the map. This shift to cosmic horror and dark magic represents a new direction for the Zombies narrative.

The map’s connection to the **Dark Aether** and **Cthulhu-esque** influences introduces a new layer of lore that would continue throughout *Black Ops III* and future Zombies maps.

### 3. **New Cast of Characters**
The map features four playable characters, each representing a different aspect of the city's crime-ridden underworld, and all voiced by well-known actors:
- **Nero Blackstone** (voiced by Jeff Goldblum): A magician who killed his wife in a botched insurance fraud scheme.
- **Jessica Rose** (voiced by Heather Graham): A femme fatale actress who murdered her blackmailer.
- **Floyd Campbell** (voiced by Ron Perlman): A boxer who rigged a fight and killed his opponent in the process.
- **Jack Vincent** (voiced by Neal McDonough): A corrupt cop who murdered a man to cover up his crimes.

Each character is tied to Morg City’s dark underworld, and they are being punished for their sins by the mysterious figure known as the **Shadow Man**. The Shadow Man manipulates them into performing rituals that ultimately serve the Apothicons.

### 4. **The Beast Mode**
One of the key mechanics in *Shadows of Evil* is **Beast Mode**, a feature similar to Afterlife mode from *Mob of the Dead*. Players can activate Beast Mode by interacting with glowing purple flames scattered around the map. In this mode, players transform into a tentacled monster, gaining special abilities such as:
- Destroying obstacles.
- Powering up switches.
- Reviving downed teammates.
- Accessing hidden areas or performing map-related tasks.

Beast Mode is essential for progressing through the map, as players must use it to unlock areas, turn on the power, and complete objectives. Managing when and how to use Beast Mode is key to mastering the map.

### 5. **Rituals and the Pack-a-Punch**
To access the **Pack-a-Punch** machine in *Shadows of Evil*, players must complete a series of **rituals** in various locations around the map. Each ritual is tied to one of the characters’ sins, and they must be completed in specific rooms tied to their crimes (e.g., the theater, the boxing gym, etc.).

The rituals require players to defend themselves from **Margwa Heart** enemies (three-headed bosses) and waves of zombies while performing the task. Once all the rituals are completed, players unlock the **Pack-a-Punch** machine, which is located in the **Apothicon Rift**, an underground area accessible through portals.

### 6. **The Wonder Weapon: The Apothicon Servant**
The **Apothicon Servant** is one of the most powerful and iconic Wonder Weapons in Zombies history. It is a creature-like gun that shoots black holes, sucking in and killing all zombies within its range. Players can build it by collecting parts scattered throughout the map.

Once assembled, the Apothicon Servant becomes an essential tool for crowd control and surviving higher rounds. Its immense power and ability to clear large areas make it a fan-favorite Wonder Weapon.

### 7. **New Enemies: The Margwa and Parasites**
*Shadows of Evil* introduced several new types of enemies to keep players on their toes:
- **Margwa**: A large, three-headed monster that spawns during specific rounds or after completing rituals. Players must shoot its glowing heads to defeat it. The Margwa is one of the most challenging and dangerous enemies in the game due to its high health and devastating melee attacks.
- **Parasites**: Small, flying creatures that spawn during special rounds. They are fast-moving and can swarm players if not dealt with quickly. Parasite rounds replace the typical "dog rounds" from previous maps.
- **Meatballs**: Rolling explosive enemies that can cause damage upon contact, adding an additional hazard to navigate in tight areas.

These enemies contribute to the difficulty of the map, especially when they appear in combination with regular zombies during higher rounds.

### 8. **The Easter Egg: Apocalypse Averted**
*Shadows of Evil* features an intricate **Easter egg** quest called **"Apocalypse Averted"**, which requires players to work together to uncover the truth behind the Shadow Man and the Apothicon threat. Completing the Easter egg involves:
- Summoning the **Civil Protector**, a robotic ally that helps defend players.
- Collecting **Gateworms** and placing them in specific locations to open portals.
- Summoning and ultimately defeating the **Shadow Man**, who is revealed to be manipulating the characters to serve the Apothicons.

The Easter egg quest is challenging and requires teamwork, map knowledge, and precise timing. Completing the quest reveals a cutscene that ties into the broader Zombies storyline and introduces the **Keeper** and **Apothicon** factions, setting the stage for future maps in *Black Ops III*.

### 9. **GobbleGums**
*Shadows of Evil* also introduced the **GobbleGum** mechanic to Zombies mode. Players could use GobbleGums—special abilities unlocked through the GobbleGum machine—giving them temporary buffs or bonuses. These abilities ranged from extra perks to increased ammo and teleportation, providing players with new ways to strategize and survive.

The introduction of **GobbleGums** added more depth to gameplay and gave players an additional layer of strategy, allowing for customized loadouts and abilities that could turn the tide in a game.

### 10. **Map Design and Strategy**
*Shadows of Evil* is a large, multi-layered map with intricate pathways, portals, and verticality. The map design encourages exploration, as players must navigate through different districts—**Waterfront**, **Footlight**, and **Canal**—each with its own unique areas, enemies, and challenges.

- Players can utilize **tram cars** to quickly move between the different districts, but this system requires careful coordination, especially in higher rounds.
- **Beast Mode** is essential for unlocking hidden areas and turning on key features like perk machines and the Pack-a-Punch, so mastering when to activate it is crucial.
- **Zombie trains** (gathering zombies in a large group and running in circles) are often run in wide-open areas like the **Ritual Rooms** or **Pack-a-Punch Room**, which provide space to avoid getting trapped by the horde.

### 11. **Legacy and Reception**
*Shadows of Evil* is often praised for its **atmosphere**, **complexity**, and the introduction of new mechanics like **Beast Mode**, **rituals**, and **GobbleGums**. The map’s blend of a noir setting with supernatural horror created a unique experience that set it apart from previous Zombies maps. Its deep connection to the overarching Aether storyline and introduction of the **Apothicons** also helped expand the Zombies universe in exciting new directions.

However, some players found the map overwhelming due to its complexity and difficulty, particularly with the demanding Easter egg steps and reliance on Beast Mode for progression.

### Final Thoughts
*Shadows of Evil* is a groundbreaking Zombies map that pushed the boundaries of the series with its rich lore, intricate mechanics, and immersive atmosphere. From the dark and moody Morg City to the intense boss fights with the Margwa and Shadow Man, the map offers a memorable experience that combines strategy, teamwork, and high-level gameplay. It set the tone for the *Black Ops III* Zombies experience, establishing the Apothicon storyline that would continue through future maps.

**The Giant** is a Zombies map from *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*, and it’s a remastered version of the classic **Der Riese** map from *World at War*. It was released as part of the **Black Ops III: Zombies Chronicles** DLC and serves as a key map in the ongoing **Aether** storyline. While it stays true to the original *Der Riese* layout, it adds new features, modern mechanics, and deeper lore that connect to the broader storyline. Here’s what makes **The Giant** special:

### 1. **Setting: Der Riese Facility**
*The Giant* is set in the same **Group 935 research facility** as the original *Der Riese* map, located in Germany during **World War II**. The facility is heavily tied to the experiments with **Element 115**, which resulted in the creation of zombies. The map is full of Nazi symbols, secret laboratories, and war-torn structures, giving it a dark and eerie atmosphere.

The facility's key feature is the **teleporters**, which allow players to travel quickly across the map and are essential for unlocking the **Pack-a-Punch** machine.

### 2. **Return of the Primis Crew**
Unlike the original *Der Riese*, which featured the **Ultimis** versions of the main characters, **The Giant** focuses on the **Primis crew**:
- **Tank Dempsey**
- **Nikolai Belinski**
- **Takeo Masaki**
- **Edward Richtofen**

This map marks an important point in the storyline, where **Primis Richtofen** kills his **Ultimis counterpart**, setting off a chain of events that significantly affects the Aether storyline. The characters' dialogue and interactions in *The Giant* reflect their growing awareness of their importance in the larger fight against the Apothicons and the forces of the Aether.

### 3. **Classic Gameplay**
*The Giant* retains the classic layout and mechanics that made **Der Riese** so beloved:
- **Pack-a-Punch**: The **Pack-a-Punch machine** is locked behind three teleporters, which players must activate by linking them to the central hub. Once all three teleporters are linked, players can upgrade their weapons using the machine.
- **Teleports**: These allow quick movement across the map, providing an escape from tight situations and allowing for efficient navigation.
- **Traps**: The map features **electric traps**, which players can activate to kill zombies and control the flow of the horde.
- **Catwalk Strategy**: One of the most popular strategies is to hold out on the **catwalk**, a narrow corridor where players can create a defensive position and hold off waves of zombies.

### 4. **New Additions and Features**
While *The Giant* remains largely faithful to the original map, it incorporates modern elements from **Black Ops III Zombies**, including:
- **GobbleGums**: The addition of **GobbleGums** gives players access to a variety of perks and abilities that didn’t exist in the original *Der Riese*. These can be game-changing, giving players more tactical options for survival.
- **Easter Eggs**: *The Giant* features several **Easter eggs**, including a mini-Easter egg quest that references **Samantha Maxis** and **Dr. Maxis**, continuing the deeper lore of Group 935 and their experiments with Element 115.
- **New Weapons**: Players can use a variety of new weapons and Wonder Weapons from *Black Ops III*, giving them more firepower than the original map allowed.

### 5. **The Fly Trap Easter Egg**
One of the most famous Easter eggs from the original *Der Riese* returns in **The Giant**—the **Fly Trap Easter egg**. To activate it, players must shoot a panel outside the map with a Pack-a-Punched weapon, which then triggers a game of hide-and-seek involving hidden objects scattered across the map.

While the Fly Trap Easter egg is relatively simple compared to modern Zombies Easter eggs, it’s a beloved feature that ties into the history of *Der Riese* and Samantha Maxis.

### 6. **The Story and Richtofen’s Plan**
*The Giant* plays a pivotal role in the **Aether** storyline, as it’s here that **Primis Richtofen** kills his **Ultimis self**, drastically altering the timeline and setting the events of *Black Ops III* in motion. The story in *The Giant* ties into Richtofen’s quest to control the **Aether** and prevent the rise of the **Apothicons**, ancient cosmic beings seeking to dominate all realities.

The map’s narrative also references the ongoing conflict between **Dr. Maxis** and Richtofen, both of whom have competing plans for the use of Element 115 and control over the zombies.

### 7. **Nostalgia and Legacy**
For many Zombies fans, *The Giant* is a nostalgic return to one of the most beloved maps in Zombies history. The original *Der Riese* introduced many iconic features, such as the **Pack-a-Punch** machine and teleporters, that became staples in later maps. *The Giant* honors that legacy by staying faithful to the original design while adding modern elements that improve gameplay without compromising the core experience.

### 8. **Strategy and Replayability**
Because of its balanced layout and straightforward design, *The Giant* is ideal for both new and veteran players. The map’s open areas and choke points make it perfect for **zombie training** (gathering zombies in a group and running in circles to manage them), while the catwalk remains a favorite spot for holding out against higher rounds.

The **teleporters** and **Pack-a-Punch** machine also add a strategic element, as players need to balance offense with defense and move efficiently across the map to survive.

### Final Thoughts
*The Giant* is a perfect blend of classic Zombies gameplay with modern updates. Its combination of tight, intense combat areas and the emotional weight of its role in the Aether storyline makes it one of the standout maps in *Black Ops III*. Whether you're a longtime fan of *Der Riese* or a newcomer to the series, *The Giant* offers a rich, replayable experience that holds a special place in Zombies history.

Do you enjoy the nostalgic feel of *The Giant*, or do you prefer the more complex mechanics of newer maps? What’s your go-to strategy for high rounds on this map?


**Der Eisendrache** is one of the most iconic and well-loved Zombies maps from *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*, released as part of the **Awakening DLC**. Set in a medieval Austrian castle during World War II, the map features a blend of historical and supernatural elements, a rich storyline that ties into the larger **Aether** narrative, and a variety of innovative gameplay mechanics. It is often regarded as one of the best maps in Zombies history for its combination of Easter eggs, Wonder Weapons, and engaging layout. Here’s why **Der Eisendrache** is so significant:

### 1. **Setting: Griffin Castle**
*Der Eisendrache* is set in **Griffin Castle**, an ancient structure located high in the Austrian Alps. The castle was repurposed by **Group 935** during World War II for experiments with **Element 115**. It’s filled with secret laboratories, ancient artifacts, and a massive rocket launch site located nearby. The map blends medieval architecture with high-tech war machines and Element 115-infused devices.

The castle’s atmosphere is both haunting and epic, featuring snowy mountain views, gothic interiors, and ominous hints of otherworldly powers lurking beneath the surface. It is a key location in the **Aether storyline**, especially for **Primis**—the four main characters: **Tank Dempsey**, **Nikolai Belinski**, **Takeo Masaki**, and **Edward Richtofen**.

### 2. **The Primis Crew and Storyline**
In *Der Eisendrache*, the **Primis** crew continues their quest to stop **Ultimis Richtofen’s** twisted plans by collecting artifacts and altering the timeline. The map is a direct continuation of the events in **The Giant**, where **Primis Richtofen** killed his **Ultimis counterpart**.

The crew’s mission in *Der Eisendrache* is to retrieve **Dempsey’s** soul and prevent Group 935’s research from furthering the Apothicon agenda. This map features heavy dialogue between the characters, exploring their pasts and motivations as they face a personal and cosmic battle.

### 3. **The Four Elemental Bows**
One of the most iconic features in *Der Eisendrache* is the introduction of the **Wrath of the Ancients**, a powerful bow that players can upgrade into one of four **Elemental Bows**. These are similar to the **Elemental Staffs** from *Origins* but with different powers and upgrades:
- **Storm Bow (Kreema’ahm la Ahmahm)**: Shoots lightning arrows that electrocute and chain damage through groups of zombies.
- **Fire Bow (Kreeholo lu Kreemasaleet)**: Shoots fire arrows that create fiery explosions and burn zombies in a large area.
- **Wolf Bow (Kreeholo na Ostaut)**: Summons ghostly wolves to attack zombies, creating a tornado-like vortex that pulls zombies in.
- **Void Bow (Kreegakaleet lu Ganoon)**: Summons skulls that rip apart zombies with dark energy, causing them to disintegrate.

Each bow requires players to complete a series of challenging steps, solving puzzles and completing tasks around the map. The Elemental Bows are crucial for both high-round survival and the **Easter egg** quest, making them an essential part of the map’s strategy.

### 4. **New Enemies: The Panzer Soldat**
The **Panzer Soldat** returns in *Der Eisendrache* after its debut in *Origins*. This heavily armored enemy is equipped with a **flamethrower** and a **claw arm** that can pull players in. The Panzer Soldat is tough to kill and appears during certain rounds, forcing players to use their most powerful weapons, like the upgraded Elemental Bows, to take it down.

The return of the Panzer Soldat adds an extra layer of difficulty, especially during high rounds, as its presence can overwhelm players if they’re not prepared.

### 5. **The Ragnarok DG-4**
*Der Eisendrache* introduces a new buildable Wonder Weapon called the **Ragnarok DG-4**, a set of gravity spikes that players can slam into the ground to kill zombies and stun enemies. The Ragnarok DG-4 can also be placed on the ground as a trap, creating an energy field that kills zombies in a large area. This weapon is a powerful tool for crowd control and is essential for the later stages of the Easter egg.

### 6. **The Rocket Test Area and Pack-a-Punch**
In addition to the main castle area, *Der Eisendrache* features a **Rocket Test Site**, which players can access via teleporters. This area houses the **Pack-a-Punch** machine and is key to progressing through the map’s challenges. The rocket itself periodically goes through test launches, which can kill players and zombies if they are caught in the blast, adding an extra challenge to navigating the map.

The Pack-a-Punch machine can be accessed by teleporting to the Rocket Test Site and unlocking it by powering specific terminals around the map. Once unlocked, players can upgrade their weapons to stand a better chance against the increasing difficulty of zombie waves and the Panzer Soldat.

### 7. **The Easter Egg: My Brother’s Keeper**
The **“My Brother’s Keeper”** Easter egg quest in *Der Eisendrache* is one of the most significant in the Zombies storyline, as it involves **Dempsey’s soul** and the ongoing struggle between the Primis crew and the forces of the **Apothicons**. The Easter egg involves several complex steps, including:
- Upgrading the Elemental Bows.
- Shooting down a **rocket** carrying **Ultimis Dempsey**.
- Summoning and fighting the **Keeper**, an ancient being that helps Primis throughout the map.

The quest culminates with **Primis Richtofen** trapping **Dempsey’s soul** in the **Summoning Key**, marking a major turning point in the Zombies storyline. This event directly ties into the events of later maps, such as *Zetsubou No Shima* and *Revelations*.

### 8. **Anti-Gravity and Wall-Running**
*Der Eisendrache* features **anti-gravity zones** in certain areas of the map, most notably in the **Undercroft**, where players can **wall-run** to avoid zombies and access hidden areas. These mechanics add a layer of verticality to the gameplay and give players more mobility options to survive the undead hordes.

Wall-running is also essential for certain steps of the Easter egg and upgrading the Elemental Bows, making it an important skill to master.

### 9. **Map Layout and Strategy**
The map’s layout is highly interconnected, with several key areas, including the **Main Castle**, **Undercroft**, **Rocket Test Site**, and **Courtyard**. Each section of the map has its own set of challenges and opportunities for zombie training, but players must carefully manage their movement and teamwork to survive.

Popular strategies often involve upgrading the **Storm Bow** or **Wolf Bow** early, as these are highly effective for dealing with large groups of zombies and the Panzer Soldat. The **catwalk** near the **Death Ray** is a common spot for running **zombie trains**, as it offers a mix of open space and defensive options.

### 10. **Legacy and Reception**
*Der Eisendrache* is widely regarded as one of the best Zombies maps ever created. Its combination of engaging gameplay mechanics, a deeply immersive setting, and a pivotal story in the Aether arc has made it a fan favorite. The **Elemental Bows**, **Ragnarok DG-4**, and **Panzer Soldat** provide a mix of classic and new gameplay challenges that keep the map fresh and exciting, even for veteran players.

The Easter egg, which is challenging but not overly convoluted, provides a satisfying narrative conclusion, with Dempsey’s soul being captured as part of Richtofen’s grand plan. The map’s role in the greater Zombies storyline has cemented its place as a pivotal moment in the Aether saga.

### Final Thoughts
*Der Eisendrache* is a Zombies masterpiece that offers a perfect blend of difficulty, strategy, and lore. Its stunning setting, powerful Wonder Weapons, and exciting Easter egg make it one of the most memorable maps in Zombies history. Whether you’re upgrading the Elemental Bows, battling the Panzer Soldat, or racing to complete the Easter egg, *Der Eisendrache* delivers an intense and rewarding experience.

What’s your favorite Elemental Bow in *Der Eisendrache*, and do you enjoy tackling the Easter egg, or do you prefer just surviving in high rounds?


**Zetsubou No Shima** is the second Zombies map in *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*, released as part of the **Eclipse DLC**. Set on a remote Pacific island during World War II, the map is heavily influenced by elements of survival horror, featuring dense jungles, hidden laboratories, and biological experiments gone wrong. It is widely regarded as one of the most complex and atmospheric maps in the **Aether storyline**, with a focus on environmental dangers and intricate gameplay mechanics. Here's what makes **Zetsubou No Shima** stand out:

### 1. **Setting: A Mysterious Pacific Island**
*Zetsubou No Shima* is set on **Division 9's** remote island facility, where the Japanese scientific division experimented with **Element 115**, resulting in mutated plants, giant spiders, and hordes of zombies. The island is covered in dense jungle, with swampy terrain, overgrown laboratories, and a massive underground bunker system.

The map’s setting gives it a creepy, survival-horror vibe, as players explore a decaying facility overrun by experiments gone wrong. The facility’s research has led to plant mutations, bioengineered zombies, and the rise of **Thrasher** zombies, all of which contribute to the map’s eerie atmosphere.

### 2. **The Primis Crew and Storyline**
The **Primis crew**—**Tank Dempsey**, **Nikolai Belinski**, **Takeo Masaki**, and **Edward Richtofen**—continue their journey to collect the souls of their **Ultimis counterparts** in order to execute **Richtofen’s** grand plan. In *Zetsubou No Shima*, the focus is on **Takeo Masaki**, as the crew works to confront his **Ultimis self**, who has been driven insane by the experiments on the island.

The map explores Takeo's deep connection to honor and duty, as he faces his corrupted past. The story here delves into themes of loyalty and sacrifice, as Takeo confronts the broken legacy of his former self.

### 3. **Environmental Hazards and Map Complexity**
*Zetsubou No Shima* is known for its **environmental hazards** and **complex gameplay mechanics**:
- **Water Irrigation System**: One of the map’s core mechanics involves collecting water from different sources (blue, purple, and green) and using it to grow plants that offer a variety of benefits. Plants can provide power-ups, weapons, or even help with zombie control, depending on how they’re nurtured. This farming system adds a layer of strategy and resource management.
- **Traps and Hazards**: The island is filled with dangers, including **spore pods** that release gas when disturbed, **trap doors**, and electrified water. Navigating these hazards is essential to survival.
- **Power System**: Powering the map requires players to find and water specific plants and generators scattered across different areas. This is more complicated than the traditional single power switch, as players must manage multiple power sources.
- **Underwater Areas**: There are several **underwater sections** on the map, requiring players to manage their oxygen levels while fending off zombies. One of the key steps to unlocking the **Pack-a-Punch** machine takes place in an underwater chamber, adding to the complexity.

These environmental dangers make the map one of the more difficult and intricate in Zombies history, as players must juggle multiple tasks while surviving the undead.

### 4. **New Enemies: Thrasher and Spiders**
*Zetsubou No Shima* introduces two unique enemies that ramp up the difficulty:
- **Thrasher**: A mutated zombie that spawns when certain spores are triggered. It is larger, tougher, and has the ability to trap players by summoning other zombies. The Thrasher is a major threat, especially in tight spaces.
- **Spiders**: Replacing the typical "dog rounds" in this map, **spiders** spawn during specific rounds and act as fast, small enemies that can overwhelm players. They also block paths with webs, which players must clear to progress.

Additionally, players face **spider bosses**, which are larger versions of the regular spiders. These bosses play a role in one of the map’s Easter egg steps and are key to acquiring a special item.

### 5. **Wonder Weapons: KT-4 and Skull of Nan Sapwe**
*Zetsubou No Shima* features two main Wonder Weapons:
- **KT-4**: A biological weapon that shoots acid, creating puddles that damage and slow zombies. The KT-4 is essential for controlling zombie hordes and completing certain steps of the Easter egg. It can be upgraded into the **Masamune**, a more powerful version of the weapon.
- **Skull of Nan Sapwe**: A special weapon that players acquire through a side quest involving challenges from ancient shrines. The Skull of Nan Sapwe has two modes: one that stuns and immobilizes zombies, and another that vaporizes them. This weapon is highly useful for crowd control and is critical for certain steps in the map’s Easter egg.

### 6. **The Easter Egg: Seeds of Doubt**
The **“Seeds of Doubt”** Easter egg quest in *Zetsubou No Shima* revolves around **Takeo**’s story and involves a series of intricate tasks, including:
- Activating ancient shrines.
- Growing specific plants to progress through different steps.
- Fighting a **giant spider** boss, which rewards players with **Widow’s Wine** and a special item.
- Using the **Masamune** Wonder Weapon to progress through puzzles.

The Easter egg culminates in a dramatic and emotional cutscene where **Ultimis Takeo** confronts his **Primis self**, and **Primis Takeo** ultimately delivers a merciful end to his corrupted counterpart. This moment is a turning point for Takeo’s character and marks another soul collected for Richtofen’s plan.

### 7. **Pack-a-Punch and Power**
The **Pack-a-Punch machine** in *Zetsubou No Shima* is hidden behind multiple steps, including draining water from an underground chamber and fighting waves of zombies in tight spaces. Powering the map is also more complex than usual, as players must activate power generators at different locations and solve a puzzle to fully turn on the power.

### 8. **Plant Growth and the Irrigation System**
The map’s **plant growth** system is a key mechanic that requires players to water seeds with different types of water, each offering different effects:
- **Blue Water**: Can create plants that provide ammo or traps to slow down zombies.
- **Purple Water**: Creates plants that can hold zombies, offering a way to control the horde.
- **Green Water**: Used for specific steps in the Easter egg, like upgrading the KT-4 to the Masamune.

Plants are grown by watering them across multiple rounds, adding a long-term planning element to the gameplay. The randomness of what each plant produces also introduces an element of unpredictability.

### 9. **GobbleGums and Strategy**
Like other *Black Ops III* maps, *Zetsubou No Shima* incorporates the **GobbleGum** system, allowing players to access temporary perks or abilities that can dramatically alter gameplay. This adds an extra layer of strategy, especially when dealing with the map’s more complex challenges.

Popular strategies include:
- **Zombie trains**: Running trains in open areas like the **Bunker** or **Lab A** to deal with large groups of zombies.
- Prioritizing the upgrade of the **Masamune**, as it is essential for both survival and the Easter egg.
- Completing the **Skull of Nan Sapwe** quest early for an additional powerful weapon.

### 10. **Legacy and Reception**
*Zetsubou No Shima* is often regarded as one of the most complex and challenging Zombies maps. While its intricacy and environmental hazards have drawn criticism from some players, others appreciate its strategic depth, unique setting, and character-driven storyline. The map’s dark atmosphere and connection to Takeo’s story arc make it an emotionally impactful chapter in the Aether saga.

Despite being polarizing, *Zetsubou No Shima* has its fans who admire its elaborate mechanics, creepy atmosphere, and the emotional weight of Takeo’s journey. The use of environmental hazards and puzzles makes it stand out from other maps in the Zombies series.

### Final Thoughts
*Zetsubou No Shima* is a highly intricate map that demands careful planning, resource management, and teamwork to navigate its environmental hazards and complete its Easter egg. Its blend of biological horror, complex mechanics, and deep lore make it one of the more unique maps in the Zombies lineup.

Do you enjoy the complexity of *Zetsubou No Shima*, or do you prefer more straightforward maps? What’s your favorite strategy for surviving its many dangers?


**Gorod Krovi** is one of the most action-packed and beloved Zombies maps from *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*, released as part of the **Descent DLC**. Set in an alternate-history **Stalingrad**, overrun by zombies, **dragon attacks**, and **mechanized soldiers**, the map offers an intense and cinematic experience while continuing the **Aether storyline**. *Gorod Krovi* stands out for its epic scale, fast-paced gameplay, and combination of futuristic technology and historical warfare. Here’s what makes **Gorod Krovi** such a significant map:

### 1. **Setting: Stalingrad, Russia**
*Gorod Krovi* takes place in **Stalingrad** during an alternate history of **World War II**, where **Element 115** experimentation has unleashed dragons, zombies, and **mechanized soldiers**. The city is in ruins, with burning buildings, wreckage from crashed German and Soviet war machines, and futuristic technology left behind by **Group 935**. The dragons, which fly overhead and periodically attack, give the map a unique twist, combining historical warfare with high-tech sci-fi and supernatural elements.

This chaotic setting makes for a dramatic battlefield, filled with tight alleyways, large open courtyards, and underground bunkers.

### 2. **The Primis Crew and Storyline**
In *Gorod Krovi*, the **Primis crew**—**Tank Dempsey**, **Nikolai Belinski**, **Takeo Masaki**, and **Edward Richtofen**—arrive in Stalingrad as part of their ongoing mission to collect the souls of their **Ultimis** counterparts. This time, they’re after **Nikolai’s soul**, the last one needed to complete **Richtofen’s** plan to control the **Aether**.

The story in *Gorod Krovi* focuses heavily on **Nikolai** and his confrontation with his **Ultimis** self, a broken and cynical version of the once proud soldier. This emotional storyline explores Nikolai’s feelings of guilt, betrayal, and the horrors of war, adding depth to his character.

### 3. **Dragons: Aerial and Ground Hazards**
One of the most unique aspects of *Gorod Krovi* is the inclusion of **dragons**. These massive, fire-breathing beasts fly over the map and periodically unleash firebombs on certain areas, forcing players to stay alert and avoid being burned. The dragons add a dynamic layer to the map’s gameplay, as players must constantly be aware of where the fire will land.

In addition to the flying dragons, players can also summon a dragon to **ride** between different parts of the map. This fast travel system takes players from the main battlefield to a **Russian facility** where the **Pack-a-Punch machine** is located.

### 4. **New Enemies: Valkyrie Drones and Manglers**
*Gorod Krovi* introduces several new enemy types that increase the difficulty of the map:
- **Valkyrie Drones**: These flying robots spawn during specific rounds and attack players with electric shocks. While they aren’t as tough as zombies, they can quickly overwhelm players if left unchecked.
- **Russian Manglers**: A heavily armored enemy equipped with a **plasma cannon** and a **mechanized claw**. The Manglers are formidable foes, with their high health and ranged attacks making them a significant threat. Players must target their weak points to bring them down effectively.

These enemies add to the fast-paced, chaotic nature of the map, as they attack alongside regular zombies, making it difficult for players to manage the horde.

### 5. **Wonder Weapons: The GKZ-45 Mk3 (Ray Gun Mark III)**
*Gorod Krovi* features the **GKZ-45 Mk3**, also known as the **Ray Gun Mark III**, a dual-wield Wonder Weapon that combines the classic **Ray Gun** with a new energy weapon. The left trigger fires the traditional Ray Gun blasts, while the right trigger fires an energy ball that slows and traps zombies. When both are fired together, they create a powerful vortex that decimates zombies caught in its range.

The **Ray Gun Mark III** is essential for high-round survival, as it excels at both crowd control and damage output, making it one of the most versatile Wonder Weapons in the game.

### 6. **The Gauntlet of Siegfried**
Another unique Wonder Weapon in *Gorod Krovi* is the **Gauntlet of Siegfried**, a dragon-powered gauntlet that lets players summon a **mini-dragon** to fight by their side. The dragon breathes fire and attacks zombies, acting as a mobile defense unit. Additionally, players can use the Gauntlet to perform a powerful punch attack that sends zombies flying.

The Gauntlet of Siegfried is acquired through a multi-step side quest, which involves navigating challenges, collecting parts, and fighting zombies in specific areas.

### 7. **The Easter Egg: Love and War**
The **“Love and War”** Easter egg in *Gorod Krovi* is one of the most challenging and action-packed Easter eggs in the Zombies series. It involves several complex steps, including:
- Collecting **dragon eggs** and completing challenges to hatch and raise the dragon.

**Revelations** is the final Zombies map of *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*, released as part of the **Salvation DLC**. It is the conclusion of the **Aether storyline** that had been building since the early Zombies maps, bringing together locations, characters, and elements from across the entire saga. *Revelations* is known for its ambitious map design, where different parts of iconic maps are stitched together in a reality-breaking manner, creating a truly surreal and epic experience. Here’s why **Revelations** is such a significant map:

### 1. **Setting: The House and The Apothicons**
*Revelations* takes place in a fractured reality, where the **Apothicons**—ancient cosmic beings—are trying to destroy the universe and control the **Aether**. The **Primis crew**—**Tank Dempsey**, **Nikolai Belinski**, **Takeo Masaki**, and **Edward Richtofen**—must prevent the complete collapse of existence and defeat the **Shadow Man**, a powerful servant of the Apothicons.

The map begins at **The House**, a sanctuary where **Dr. Monty**, a mysterious god-like figure, tries to protect the universe from the Apothicons. The map itself is a patchwork of iconic locations from previous Zombies maps, pulled together into a chaotic, reality-bending landscape.

### 2. **Locations from Previous Maps**
One of the defining features of *Revelations* is that it brings together parts of several classic Zombies maps, allowing players to revisit iconic locations:
- **Der Eisendrache**: The courtyard and the Undercroft are part of the map, providing familiar areas to run zombie trains and access perks.
- **Origins**: The dig site from *Origins* is included, along with the **Crazy Place**, giving the map a mystical and apocalyptic feel.
- **Mob of the Dead**: The cafeteria and prison yard from *Mob of the Dead* return, haunted by the memories of the past.
- **Kino der Toten**: The main theater room from *Kino der Toten* serves as a central area, with the **teleporter** and **Pack-a-Punch machine**.
- **Shangri-La**, **Verkühnst der Toten**, **Nacht der Untoten**, and others: Each of these maps has sections incorporated into *Revelations*, creating a surreal, fragmented environment that plays with nostalgia.

This mix of iconic locations not only serves as a nostalgic trip for longtime Zombies players but also represents the fracturing of the universe caused by the Apothicons’ interference.

### 3. **The Primis Crew and Storyline**
In *Revelations*, the **Primis crew** is on their final mission to defeat the Apothicons and secure the future of the universe. After collecting the souls of their **Ultimis** counterparts in previous maps, **Richtofen** and the team face their greatest challenge yet: stopping the **Shadow Man** and the Apothicons from destroying everything.

The map explores the culmination of the Primis crew’s journey, reflecting on their personal struggles, sacrifices, and the weight of their mission. **Dr. Monty**, the mysterious figure guiding the crew, plays a major role in the story, though his true motives remain unclear until the end. The storyline also delves deeper into the complex mythology of the **Aether**, **Apothicons**, and **Keepers**, the latter being ancient beings fighting against the Apothicons.

### 4. **New Enemies: The Apothicons**
The **Apothicons** are the central antagonists in *Revelations*. These massive, ancient creatures serve as bosses and hazards throughout the map. The most notable Apothicon is the **Apothicon Overlord**, a gigantic, tentacled creature that players must fight during the Easter egg quest. Its massive mouth is used as a **portal** to teleport to different areas of the map.

The map also features **Corrupted Keepers**, which appear in certain rituals, and **Margwas**, the three-headed bosses from *Shadows of Evil*, return to challenge players during certain rounds.

### 5. **Wonder Weapons**
*Revelations* brings back several iconic **Wonder Weapons** from previous maps:
- **Thunder Gun**: The powerful **Thunder Gun** from *Kino der Toten* returns, providing players with a devastating weapon for crowd control.
- **Apothicon Servant**: The **Apothicon Servant** from *Shadows of Evil* also makes a return, allowing players to fire black holes that suck in zombies and clear large areas.
- **Lil' Arnies**: These are similar to the **Monkey Bombs**, but in *Revelations*, they take the form of Lovecraftian creatures that distract zombies and kill them in gruesome ways.
- **The Ragnaroks**: Returning from *Der Eisendrache*, these gravity spikes help players kill zombies and control hordes.
- **Upgraded Wonder Weapons**: Players can upgrade Wonder Weapons like the **Apothicon Servant** by performing certain tasks, making them even more powerful.

### 6. **The Shield: Guard of Fafnir**
*Revelations* includes a buildable shield known as the **Guard of Fafnir**, which provides both defense and offense. The shield has the ability to blast zombies with fiery projectiles, making it an essential tool for surviving in the later rounds of the game.

### 7. **The Easter Egg: A Better Tomorrow**
The **"A Better Tomorrow"** Easter egg quest is one of the most challenging and important quests in the Zombies storyline. The goal of the Easter egg is to defeat the **Shadow Man** and end the Apothicon threat. The Easter egg involves a complex series of steps, including:
- Activating **Corruption Engines** to control key areas of the map.
- Completing challenges from **Dr. Monty**.
- Using the **Apothicon Overlord** to access different areas.
- Battling waves of zombies, **Margwas**, and **Keepers**.
- Fighting the **Shadow Man** in an epic final battle, which involves trapping him in a ritual to destroy him once and for all.

The final step involves **Primis Richtofen** and the crew successfully defeating the **Shadow Man**, but in a surprising twist, it’s revealed that **Dr. Monty** has his own agenda. He betrays the crew, sending them to **an endless cycle of time loops**, erasing the Primis crew’s memories and restarting their journey from the beginning, with the events of *Origins* happening all over again.

### 8. **Pack-a-Punch and Corruption Engines**
The **Pack-a-Punch** machine in *Revelations* is located inside the **Apothicon Overlord’s** mouth. Players must activate four **Corruption Engines** scattered across the map to unlock access to the Pack-a-Punch. These engines are located in different parts of the map, and players must defend them from zombies while they charge up.

Once all four engines are activated, players can enter the Apothicon Overlord’s mouth and use the Pack-a-Punch machine to upgrade their weapons.

### 9. **GobbleGums and Strategy**
As with other *Black Ops III* maps, *Revelations* utilizes the **GobbleGum** system, allowing players to access powerful abilities and perks through GobbleGum machines. These abilities can range from bonus ammo to temporary invincibility, and they play a crucial role in managing the difficulty of the map.

Effective strategies often involve:
- Running **zombie trains** in open areas like **Kino der Toten’s theater** or **Der Eisendrache’s courtyard**.
- Prioritizing the **Thunder Gun** or **Apothicon Servant** for crowd control.
- Utilizing **GobbleGums** like **Perkaholic** (which gives all perks) to gain an advantage in the higher rounds.

### 10. **Legacy and Reception**
*Revelations* is often seen as a nostalgic love letter to the Zombies community, bringing together elements from the most iconic maps and tying up many of the loose ends in the Aether storyline. While the map’s ambitious scope and surreal design are praised, some players felt that the Easter egg ending—where **Dr. Monty** erases the crew’s memories and starts the timeline over—was a bittersweet conclusion, leaving them with more questions than answers.

Despite this, *Revelations* remains one of the most significant maps in the Zombies series, providing an epic and chaotic final chapter in the long-running storyline.

### Final Thoughts
*Revelations* is a sprawling and ambitious map that serves as both a culmination of the **Aether** storyline and a celebration of the entire Zombies saga.
